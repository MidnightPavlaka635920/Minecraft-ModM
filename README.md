# Minecraft-ModM
A CLI tool for managing Minecraft mods/plugins for servers.
## About
This project targets server owners, because it might be hard to install mods/plugins in a CLI server interface. I had that problem, and I hated when I had to update my server. So, this is the solution.
## Dependencies
- [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/) (for downloading mods/plugins)  
- A C++ compiler with C++20 support (e.g., `g++`)  
- `make` utility
- nlohmann/json library

```bash
mcmodm

## Compiling yourself
There is a Makefile. Use `make` to compile on Linux/macOS, `sudo make install` to install system-wide. Source files are in src/ and header files are in include/
On WIndoes, steps are simmilar after installing dependencies, using a MINGW64 shell.
